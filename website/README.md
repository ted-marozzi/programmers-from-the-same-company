# [Company Website](https://www.facebook.com/groups/companyfbgroup)
This is our typescript React based Company website.
It is deployed via the gh-pages branch via a command run by admins.
The deployment can be found on the right panel under active deployments or [here](https://programmers-from-the-same-company.github.io/company-website/).

To start development:
1) Create a branch BASED of master
2) Pick or create a ticket in the ToDo project and move it to in progress
3) Ensure you have an up to date version of Node.js installed. See [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4) Make changes locally (you may need to ```yarn install``` the first time I am not sure)
5) Commit and Push your branch to the repo.
6) Create a pr to master.
7) Wait for a review and resolve conversations. You may want to assign reviewers to your pr, you can always assign me ted-marozzi.
8) Squash and merge to master.

You won't see your changes in the deployment until an admin deploys, we will be changing that soon to deploy on push to master.
